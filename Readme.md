# Transformers cannot Recommend Love, not yet anyway

By enhancing personalization and privacy, recommender systems have been able to expand their
reach thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In this work, we aim to
combine the representation of textual and visual data modalities into a single latent space and examine how the recommendation system functions. We employ cosine similarity
as the recommendation method in conjunction with the Flava model to extract multimodal embeddings. Using styleGANs for image generation and random selection from the typical
dating app questions, we create artificial personalities for users. Additionally, we experiment with
five text-only models including meta-llama-3-8B. Through feature analysis, we provide a framework for assessing a model’s comprehension of
the underlying structure of data. Despite their shortcomings, we discover that our results offer a fresh approach to user profile recommendations.


# Data
The dataset used for this study was custom made using Generative AI. 

Images we made using StyleGAN (link)[https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/],

Text profiles were created using custom made traits prompted to GPT-4o
