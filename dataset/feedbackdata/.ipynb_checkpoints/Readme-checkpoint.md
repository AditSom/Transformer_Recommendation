# Get user preferences for each profile

## Method

We created a google form to generate sections of profiles - one each for Men and Women

Men Profiles: [google form link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdhG7_s3Bl7vku9KJ6RviCvSLiqQb_SuIUUUcRvA-8fPwopYw/viewform?usp=sharing)

Women Profiles: [google form link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfUY0D6GM9iUzR0Rm3PnW_AfRKNKG3tfTCM2E9jJkJR7pZ_-A/viewform?usp=sharing)

The script creates a new form and loads an image-text pair from a publicly link (attached in the url markdown files)


## Feedback
The user preferences are saved as csv files which are attached in this repository. The data in these files was used to train the recommendation system for its task.

## Usage
To replicate a similar form, one needs to attach a google service account authorization json file.
